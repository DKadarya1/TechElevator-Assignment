<p>Futbol Club Barcelona, commonly referred to as Barcelona 
    and colloquially known as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a Spanish professional football club based in Barcelona, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. 
    Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, English, and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, 
    hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports 
    team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, and the world's richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €840,8 million. 
    The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.</p>
